This directory contains the list of files, that specify the Special/Extra
requirements needed by the code-generator or any other module in the
Internal Intermediate Representation.

The requirements have been added for following reasons:
	1) There may not be a way to traverse to closely related nodes in
the actual spec
	2) Due to limitations in the spec
	3) To use the information already collected by one Module(usually
parser) during its operation phase, by another module(usually  code-generator), instead of re-collecting.

	The Special/Extra requirements have been achieved through
extension methods or members in the iir-classes.

Requirement Specification Format items in Detail:
-------------------------------------------------
Specification ID:
	Can be a section number in the VHDL LRM or any other
usefuleName/Number helping in identifying the problem (or could be event
the requirement Specification File)
	This can also be specified in the BUGS file, if any bug related to
this specification.

Date of Requirement Submission:

Related Specifications:
	Specification Id, or Filenames containing related/similar Requirements specification.

VHDL-Construct(s):
	for example: Configuration Declarations
	and also othe associated constructs like port-mapaspec,
generic-map-aspect etc.

User Module(s):
	Module needing the Requirement becomes the user module.

Developer Module(s):
	The module that satisfy  the requirement.

IIR Node(s): 
	The AIRE-spec classes that gets extended or that use proposed extensions.

Purpose: 
	Purpose of request.

Detailed Specification: 
	no particular format as long as the Developer understands the User's request :).

Status:
	Requirements Satisfied /Requirements Not yet Satisfied
/Implementation being tested  

Date of Requirement Satisfaction:

Files Modified:
	Useful for Bug Fixing.

Developer's Comments:
	Can explain situations where the extensions can be used and also
where they are not applicable. Explanation of the interfaces(methods) that have
been added to satisfy the requirement.
