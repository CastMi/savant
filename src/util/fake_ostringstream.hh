/** This class is a really really poor workaround for a missing
    "ostringstream".  It should only be used in the case where no <sstream>
    header is available as it probably is illegal and it most certainly
    leaks memory very badly. 

    The whole reason that this class exists is that sstream became available
    in g++ 2.95.4 and g++ 3.0, but it wasn't before then.  New code should use
    sstream/ostringstream, but if it's not available, this is a hacked workaround.
