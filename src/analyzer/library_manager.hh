/** This class implements the library functionality as specified in the
   LRM.  It is intended to be used as a singleton instance for all
   parsers, and can be accessed in both the parser class and via a
   static IIR member.  

   Note that the library manager is as lazy as possible about finding
   things - library declaration will initially be empty, and as things
   within it are accessed, it will grow.  For instance, work._savant_lib
   might have thousands of things in it.  Even if it does, the first time
   this library is accessed via "find_library", the declaration will be
   empty.  If at some point "work.foo.bar" is accessed, the work library
   declaration will now contain foo which will contain bar.  And, if I then
   access "work.foo.baz", the there will be one reference to foo, and
   within foo, both "bar" and "baz".  If I access "work.foo.all", then
   everything within "work.foo" will appear in the library.
