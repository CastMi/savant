  // management for the savant project.  This class encapsulates a string
  // with a list of pointers to declarations of "declarable things" of
  // VHDL.  For instance, there might be a signal "x" and a variable "x" in
  // the same entity.  In this case, the declaration_chain would have a
  // string "x" and a two elements.
  
  // In addition, each declartion chain keeps a set of hidden declaration
  // information.  The data in this set is somewhat redundant in that when
  // one declaration is hiding another there will be two pointers to a
  // single declaration in one chain.  However, the most frequent operation
  // on the symbol lookup is to retrieve the set of declarations in a
  // chain, so we're going to live with a replicated pointer in order to
  // keep lookups speedy.
