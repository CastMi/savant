      it is absolutely safe to cast straight to the class implied by the
      name.  This is in direct contrast with some methods like
      "_is_signal", which will tell you if something is a signal but it

      The other method to perform these type of operations is via the
      get_kind method.  However, this technique doesn't allow a query of
      an abstract type - it only works for leaf nodes in the inheritence
