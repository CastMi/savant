These directories contain the documentation and source code for the SAVANT project.  The
SAVANT project is an effort to build an extensible digital mixed-language, object-oriented
compiler for the hardware description language VHDL (only the '93 language standard) and
Verilog.  The software developed under the SAVANT project is freely available under the
GNU Public Library License.

The primary goal of SAVANT is to stimulate research among the VHDL community by providing
an extensible, object-oriented, well-documented intermediate form (IF) and a freely
available analyzer (SCRAM) to convert VHDL and Verilog into the IF.  Because the IF analyzer
is released in source form, the additional derived classes can be inserted into the C++ class
hierarchy.  Thus, user actions can benefit fully from the fact that the IF is
object-oriented. Consequently, no procedural interface is provided or needed.

The SAVANT project includes several elements of software support (see the file COMPONENTS
in this directory).  Instructions for installing the software are located in the file
INSTALL (this directory).  The software is freely available under the terms of the Gnu
Public Library license, included with this release.

SAVANT has been compiled and tested under Linux. Efforts have been made to make it
portable.  If you have patches to allow compilation on other platforms, if you have
success or failures on other platforms, or if you have any comments at all we'd be
interested in hearing them.

Currently, we have not ported this system to any version of Windows. 

GUIDELINES FOR BUILDING/INSTALLING SAVANT FOR SIMULATION:
---------------------------------------------------------

In order to simulate with SAVANT, some additional tools will be
required. TyVis is a C++ simulation library that works with SAVANT.
Warped2, developed at the University of Cincinnati, is a discrete event simulation
kernel.

In order to simulate VHDL with SAVANT, you'll need a compatible
version of TyVis and Warped2 as well. You can find them in these repository:

	https://github.com/CastMi/clutils
	https://github.com/CastMi/tyvis
	https://github.com/CastMi/warped2

[1] Build clutils as per the installation instructions.

[2] Build savant as per the installation instructions.

[3] Build Warped2 as per the installation instructions.

[4] Build tyvis as per the installation instructions.

If you have problems, feel free to ask.

Installation Instructions
*************************

Prerequisites:

	sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev libtool flex bison

Briefly, the shell commands:

	autoreconf -fi && mkdir obj && cd obj && ../configure --with-clutils=/usr/local && make && sudo make install

should configure, build, and install this package.
--with-clutils=/usr/local depends on where you installed clutils.
Savant will look into "/lib" for libraries and into "/include/clutils-0.0" for headers.
In the command provided, Savant will look into the folder "/usr/local/lib" for libraries and into
the folder "/usr/local/include/clutils-0.0" for headers.

Installation Names
==================

By default, 'make install' installs the package's commands under '/usr/local/bin', include
files under '/usr/local/include', etc.
