Description: UC's VHDL Analyzer Code Generator
 SAVANT is a VHDL analyzer (parser/semantic analyzer) that transforms VHDL
 into an intermediate form (AIRE).  From the AIRE representation new
 backend tools can be built.  Currently SAVANT ships with a C++ code
 generating backend that interfaces into TyVis and Warped.
