This directory contains the primary documents that describe the
overall structure and organization of SAVANT.  Each separate document is
registered in a separate subdirectory.  The documentation is written in
latex source and compatibility with the latex2html converter has been
maintained so that it can be viewed through an html browser. The html
versions of all three documents are available off the SAVANT homepage
(http://www.ececs.uc.edu/~paw/savant). 

There are currently three documents contained herein.  Their names and the
driver file therein are:

programmers/programmers.tex:
    This document was originally a set of slides for a training
    seminar for people interested in extending SAVANT.  It provides an 
    overview of the basic structure and programming interface of the 
    SCRAM c++ classes. These classes are organized in a manner to support 
    the notions of an extensible IF.  Programming exercises are included 
    to help aquaint the reader with SAVANT.

libraryManager/libraryManager.tex:
    Some quick documentation on the VHDL library manager that accompanies
    SAVANT.  At present, SAVANT uses VHDL as its file format.

simulationManual/simulationManual.tex:
    This is a set of guidelines for performing VHDL (sequential and
    parallel) simulation.
